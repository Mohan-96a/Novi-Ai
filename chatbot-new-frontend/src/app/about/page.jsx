            fancy tech. Nope, our product Novi AI is hella different. Meet Novi

            We had this idea, from of course the same movie as you're thinking,
            "Her", what if AI could be as supportive as your ride-or-die? Like,
            imagine an AI that doesn't just talk at you but truly listens—and
            remembers. NOVI AI is designed to grow with you, learning your
            quirks, preferences, and even your mood swings. Whether you're
            ranting about your boss, planning a trip, or just need a pick-me-up,
            Novi's got your back. It's not just a chatbot; it's your emotional
            sidekick. And here's the kicker: it remembers stuff. Like, if you
            told it weeks ago that you're obsessed with Taylor Swift or that
            your birthday's coming up, it'll bring it up at the perfect moment.
            Early AI bots couldn't do that. Novi? It's got memory game.

                Human relationships take time to build, and Novi works the same
                way. It doesn't just reset after every convo—it remembers you
                (within your privacy settings, of course). Novi builds a
                "persona" for you— like a personality fingerprint. Using
                retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Novi can pull info from
                the web or its memory to give you accurate, up-to-date answers.
                Pretty slick, right?
